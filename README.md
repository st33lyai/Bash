# Bash
# You are responsible for your use of any of these tools! 
This is a collection of my one-liners and scripts I have written and used during CTF's and pentesting certifications.

## imapspray
___
Simple bash script for password spraying or performing a brute force attack against email accounts on servers running imaps.

## tscrot
___
Another simple bash script. Pipe commands to it to timestamp the output of each line, then take a screenshot when the command completes. Easy tool to use so you don't need to manually take a screenshot, and save some time. Currently working on a tool that will screenshot just the terminal to minimize the amount of "arts and crafts" you need to do to and keep the screenshot simple.
